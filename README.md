Student Academic Performance Analysis

This project analyzes my academic performance across multiple semesters using SQL and Power BI.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate data analysis skills such as data modeling, SQL querying, and dashboard creation.

Project Objectives
- Analyze academic performance across semesters
- Identify strong and weak modules using Continuous Assessment (CA) scores
- Track credit distribution and pass/fail results
- Present insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard

Dataset
The dataset contains my academic records with the following attributes:
- Semester
- Module
- Credits
- CA Percentage
- Result (Pass/Fail)

File: `dataset/my_academic_performance.csv`

Tools & Technologies Used
- Oracle SQL – table creation, data insertion, analytical queries
- Power BI – dashboard creation and visualization
- GitHub – version control and project documentation
- Excel / CSV – data storage format

SQL Analysis Performed

The following analyses were done using SQL:
- Average CA percentage per semester
- Total credits per semester
- Pass vs Fail analysis
- Best and worst performing modules using `FETCH FIRST`
- Data updates and validation using `INSERT` and `UPDATE`

SQL files are available in the `sql/` folder.

Key Insights
- Overall average CA score: **72.18%**
- All modules were successfully passed
- Semester 3 showed comparatively lower performance
- Certain modules require improvement based on CA thresholds

Project Status
✅ Completed  
Future improvements may include:
- Adding GPA calculation
- Connecting Power BI directly to a database
- Expanding dataset with multiple students
